# Interview AI Test Website

This is an Interview AI testing stack designed by the [Senior Project 2021](https://haramkoo.github.io/InterviewAI/) team using the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) framework. The production is meant to be live [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/calvininterview/interview-streamlit), but it is currently down for unknown reasons.

Run the following commands to run the front-end in your machine:

*It is highly recommended that you run these commands in some sort of [Python virtual environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5vscPTWKOk).*

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The last command should launch the app in your favorite browser.
