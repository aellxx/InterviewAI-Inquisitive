    "Well, I was born in South Africa, lived there until I was 17. Came to North America of my own accord, against my parentâ€™s wishes. And was in Canada for a few years. I started school there which is where I met my wife. Transferred down to the University of Pennsylvania and got a degree in physics, degree in business at Wharton. Came out to California with the intent of doing a PHD in the material science and physics [unintelligible] with an eye towards using that as an energy storage unit for electric vehicles. I ended up deferring that graduate work to start a couple to start a couple of area companies, one of which people have heard about, such as Pay Pal.",
    "Hi my name is Maria Sanchez, and I was born in Japan. I lived there for 20 years and moved out to the United States for college. I studied graphic design and later realized that my true passion was in fashion. It's lovely to see amazing models wearing my collection this fall, can't wait to show it to you guys soon. ",
    "I moved from Indiana to California when I was 19 to pursue my career as an young entrepreneur with a small loan of million dollars. My first start up was Blindr, where we sold blinders that auto adjusts depending on the time of the day. It was revolutionary, in only 2 years, we were able to accumulate 10 million customers and gain attraction internationally. We are planning to go further beyond this year with Blindr 2.0 where not only auto adjusts your blinders, but it also detects intruders who are violating your privacy at any time. ",
    "I think things out well. When I speak, I speak with conviction. If I feel like it's something that best suits me and my person, I deal with it. I say it. I have no problem speaking out publicly about issues. But for personal things, and for things about personal selfishness, or wanting more money, I don't do that. Once I give my word, that's it. I don't go back to renegotiate. I don't renegotiate my contracts."

st.title("Interview AI Test Website")
st.caption("With the advent of machine learning, it has become increasingly clear that AI is capable of completing tasks that were hitherto considered only possible by human minds. We are now pushing the boundaries of what AI can do with natural language processing (NLP), from summarizing pages of text to keeping up a conversation with a human. Our project aims to join those on the frontier of machine learning by creating an AI Interviewer. There are two main problems to address here: first, whether creating such an interviewer will be possible, and second, whether it will be any good. The models have been fed datasets derived from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/interview-npr-media-dialog-transcripts")
