A system that encourages writers to think deeply by asking them questions.

## Flourishing in this project looks like

- Playful experimentation with user interfaces and question generation approaches
- A shared place where we're running quantitative evaluations (perhaps quick-and-dirty) of different approaches
- Eagerness to have writers try out this system
- A draft of a paper coming together (perhaps starting with the formative study writing)
- A presentation coming together, where we copy and paste examples of cool stuff (and broken stuff)



## DAISI (Deep Artificial Intelligence System for Interviews)

### About

With the advent of machine learning, it has become increasingly clear that AI is capable of completing tasks that were hitherto considered only possible by human minds. We hope to join those on the frontier of machine learning by creating an AI Interviewer, temporarily named DAISI. There are two main problems to address here: first, whether creating such an interviewer will be possible, and second, whether it will be any good. We have managed thus far to create prototype models that are capable of asking questions, and we have created qualitative metrics to score the models' performance. We have also created some quantitative metrics based on those qualitative metrics, and hope to expand our quantitative metrics further with more research. Our next step as of the writing of this About section is to iteratively create more models that will hopefully perform better than our current prototypes.

### Project

This is a research project; the focus is less on developing new software and more on refining pre-existing ones to suit our needs. Our research objective is first and foremost to see whether modern AI models can replicate the job of an interviewer to a satisfactory enough degree that we could feasibly use it for actual interviews. Should we succeed, there could be a use for the AI Interviewer, such as replacing journalists in dangerous locations like warzones. Moreover, the success of our AI Interviewer could aid in other research projects, such as AI to help writers, AI call center representatives, or any other position that involves asking questions or guiding conversations based on context.
